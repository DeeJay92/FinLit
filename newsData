                    "description1": "Since it started operating in October, the biggest breakthrough for South Africa’s A2X Markets for secondary listings came on a Monday in April.",
                    "description2": "That was when shares in Sanlam, the largest South African-based insurer, began trading on the fledgling bourse, adding to the R166bn ($13bn) company’s primary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange run by JSE Ltd.",
                    "description3": "A2X Chief Executive Officer Kevin Brady is hoping more big fish will follow.",
                    "description4": "“We aim to list as many companies as possible with a mix of Top 40, Top 100 and other companies,” Brady, a former head of equity trading at Investec, said in an emailed response to questions. “We would like to get high single-digit market share within two to three years.”",
                    "description5": "A2X is aiming to eat some of the JSE’s lunch by attracting brokerages with transacting costs about 50% lower than its giant rival, while secondary listings come at no expense to companies that join the bourse.",
                    "description6": "The exchange is also seeking a technological edge, using the same trading and surveillance technology as London’s independent Acquis Exchange",
                    "description7": "That’s led to eight listings so far, with Sanlam’s April 16 debut followed this week by Ascendis Health, the first health company to join the bourse.",
                    "description8": "While that brings the combined market value of its companies to about R220bn, A2X has more to do to win over company boards, who must approve the listings, and investors.",
                    "description9": "The start-up exchange needs to “get the big names, and international names and all of the brokers,” said Bradley Preston, a money manager at Cape Town-based Mergence Investment Managers.",
                    "description10": "A winning outcome is one that “solves the operational issues” and allows investors to “seamlessly trade on both exchanges,” he said.",
                    "description11": "The benefits of increased competition for the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are already starting to show, with JSE Ltd reducing some of its fees since A2X’s arrival, Brady said.",
                    "description12": "Still, it’s a formidable task to convince companies and traders to look beyond a bourse that ranks among the 20 largest in the world. Volume in Sanlam stock on the JSE reached 8.5 million shares on Wednesday, while 1 000 shares in the insurer changed hands on A2X on May 28, the last time the stock was traded there, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.",

                    "description13": "“By launching Lightbox, De Beers has blurred the idea of real diamonds,” said Ya’akov Almor, a diamond consultant, in an article published by The Business Times, a UK publication. “When a consumer walks up to a Lightbox salesman and asks whether the diamonds are ‘real’, what will the answer be? ",
                    "description14": "The salesman will honestly say they are real diamonds but they are manufactured in a factory. They are, however, exactly the same as the product from a mine.",

There are still delivery issues at Finsch and Cullinan, but Dippenaar has certainly taken out some of the pressure that saw the firm’s shares fall about a third on a 12-month basis.",

                    "description3": "Taxpayers can claim deductions for their contributions to medical schemes, Radebe explains. Depending on the number of members on your scheme, you could claim more credits.",
                    "description4": "'The more members or dependents there are for more months during the year of assessment (1 March to 28 February each year), the more your medical scheme fees tax credit will be,' he says. Medical scheme holders with two dependents for 12 months could claim as much as R7 200.",
                    "description5": "Radebe further explains that taxpayers could claim for 'out of pocket' medical expenses. This applies to the portion of medical expenses not covered by their schemes.",
                    "description6": "Taho clarifies that the medical scheme fees tax credit is a deduction to tax payable, as opposed to taxable income, which is the amount on which the tax liability is calculated.",
                    "description7": "She addsd that if one of the children on the medical scheme is disabled, the credit will be greater than for an able-bodied child.",
                    "description8": "Radebe explains that if you make contributions towards a pension, provident fund or retirement annuity, you can also claim deductions on taxable income.",
                    "description9": "As long as you are making contributions to the fund, then you are entitled to the deduction under Section 11F of the Income Tax Act. 'However, once you withdraw from the fund and no contributions are payable thereon, then there will be no deduction for the retirement fund contributions,' Taho says. Deductions, however, are limited. If contributions made exceed certain limits, then the claims are carried forward to the subsequent year of assessment, explains Taho. These limits are  either R350 000, or 27.5% of the person’s remuneration for the year, or 27.5% of the person’s taxable income before this deduction or a donations deduction, or a person’s taxable income before this deduction and a taxable capital gain inclusion. The contributions will then be tested against the limits of that particular year, she added.",
                    "description10": "If you feel charitable and donate to a public benefit organisation, in terms of the Income Tax Act you can also claim deductions against taxable income. However, the deduction is limited to 10% of such taxable income before claiming the donations deduction, says Hadebe.",
                    "description11": "This means if your income us R900 000, then the deduction you claim for the donation made is limited to R90 000.",
                    "description12": "'To be able to claim this deduction, one must furnish SARS with a Section 18A certificate from the public benefit organisation to which the donation was made during the year of assessment,' he explains.",
                    "description13": "'When a person has invested in a tax-free investment, interest income earned thereon is fully exempt from tax, as opposed to other investments where interest income is partially exempt - up to R23 800 exemption for persons below the age of 65, and up to R34 500 exemption for persons who are 65 years old or more than 65 years old,' said Taho.",
                    "description14": "'Upon withdrawal from, or cashing in of the tax-free investment, the amount received is also disregarded from capital gains tax,' she added. ",
                    "description15": "Contributions to the tax-free investment during the year of assessment should not exceed R33 000, and lifetime contributions towards the tax-free investment should not, in aggregate, exceed R500 000.",
                    "description16": "If contributions exceed these amounts, then 40% of the excess will be added to the person’s tax liability in that year, she warns.",
                    "description17": "Britz explains that individuals working overseas for a 183-day term could claim back tax deductions on income earned for the period they were outside the country. 'If you are employed outside the country for more than 183 days a year, and over the period more than 60 days are consecutive… the income earned for those days outside the country is tax exempt,' he explains.",
                    "description18": "If you use your vehicle for work purposes, and if you can prove to SARS that a portion of your travel expenses are for work purposes, then you can claim a deduction on it as well. Britz recommends that taxpayers keep a logbook to record the distances travelled and to get approval for this from your employer.",

Why wait a week for the next episode of your favourite series or documentary when you can binge watch at times more convenient to you? Also, why do you need those decoding boxes and satellite dishes when you can achieve a similar result with an internet connection and an app?",
                    "description3": "With the evolution of technology, on-demand internet entertainment seems destined to eventually end the era of scheduled linear television. The increase in availability and speeds of the internet, combined with a higher penetration of smartphones and smart televisions, provides an ever-growing ecosystem with greater access to the world of entertainment. Netflix has emerged as a leading provider within this entertainment service category, boasting over 130 million memberships across more than 190 countries.",
                    "description4": "From humble beginnings as a DVD-rental-by-mail firm in 1997, Netflix moved on to list on the Nasdaq in 2002 at $15 a share, only becoming profitable in the 2003 financial year, when it was still primarily a DVD shipping company. The introduction of streaming entertainment came in 2007, from which point revenue growth started its exponential path. The company now trades at around $370 a share, roughly 25 times its initial offering price. ",
                    "description5": "Their second quarter (Q2) results for 2018 once again showed strong revenue and earnings growth for the group. Revenue increased by just over 40% year-on-year, while better operating margins equated to a more than 260% increase in operating income.

The move was on the back of lower-than-expected membership growth, although it must be said that the number of members added to the subscription base was still large at 5.2m. Of these 5.2m net additions, 670 000 were in the US (estimate 1.2m) and 4.5m were international (estimate 5.2m).",
